#For a short selfpresentation
Hello, I'm Zhang.

I like doing sports like running and dancing, and also I have many hobbies.
And my favorite one is sleeping, as when we sleep, we lie down comfortably. 
And also, in dreams, everyone can be anything, like superman, like aliens, etc.
So everyday, I'd like to spend several hours on sleeping, mainly due to the first reason.

I have a lot of things want to share but I start to feel fungry when I typing now.

So maybe next time, after lunch and after siesta?

A bient√¥t.
